🏥 Patient Healthcare Dashboard – Project Summary
==================================================

This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze patient data from a healthcare system. The goal was to uncover insights related to patient demographics, treatment effectiveness, medication adherence, care satisfaction, and length of hospital stay (LOS).

The report provides health administrators and care providers with visual evidence of performance gaps and population trends, helping inform more effective care planning and policy decisions.

🔧 Tools Used
-------------
- Microsoft Power BI – for data modeling, visualization, and DAX-based KPIs
- Power Query Editor – for data transformation and cleaning

📊 Dashboard Highlights
------------------------
- **Interactive KPIs**: Adherence Rate, Follow-Up Rate, Comorbidity Rate, Total Patients, Avg Age, Avg Satisfaction Score
- **Visuals**:  
  - Patient distribution by age and gender  
  - Adherence rates by age group  
  - LOS compared by medication adherence  
  - Care satisfaction by gender  
  - Discharge destinations by location  
- **Filters**: Primary Diagnosis and Age Group
- **Custom Tooltip Page**: Hoverable insights showing Avg LOS, Satisfaction Score, and Age Group

📈 Key Insights
----------------
- Adherence & Follow-Up Rates are low (around 50%), indicating a need for better patient engagement.
- Adults (36–55) and Seniors (56–75) are the most represented age groups.
- Comorbidity Rate is high at 76%, signaling complex care requirements.
- Gender distribution is balanced, with consistent satisfaction levels across both groups.
- Patients who adhere to medications have shorter hospital stays, suggesting a clear link between adherence and recovery.
- Most patients are discharged to Home or Nursing Facilities, which highlights the importance of transitional care planning.

🎯 Impact
---------
This project demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can be applied in healthcare settings to:
- Monitor and improve treatment adherence
- Reduce unnecessary hospitalization days
- Increase patient satisfaction
- Segment patient groups for more targeted interventions
